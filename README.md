## Heya! 👋

### I'm Kshitij! 
#### I am a programmer, hacker, and software engineering enthusiast.
#### I love computer systems

- 🔭 I’m currently working on...
    - Programming software limits for current for a Formula SAE racecar using the STM32 microcontroller
    - Implementing a modified **XMODEM** protocol to send files to and from the racecar over 915Mhz radio
    - Working on [taos](https://github.com/pgosar/TAOS), an operating system written from scratch in **rust**
- 📫 How to reach me: Message me on discord *@shimadashimado*, or email me at *kshitij@utexas.edu*
- 💪🏽 I love hackathons! Here are some of my projects
    - I helped make [nectar](https://devpost.com/software/nectar-zmuwce) 🍯, a chrome extension which analyzes amazon products' sustainability, in **React** and **Express** with my friends, and we won first overall at Hack the Future 2023
    - I helped develop [hike](https://devpost.com/software/hike) 🏔️... even though we didn't win, this was the most technically impressive project that I made in the shortest amount of time as it involved making our own **email server**, a robust backend in **Hono** and **PostgreSQL**, and complicated analysis within AWS's **Lambda Functions** using **NLP**
    - I helped make [seek](https://devpost.com/software/seek-ju5cw8) 👀, a complex social media application written in **React Native**, **Express**, and **TiDB**, for which we advanced to the finalists of a hackathon with over 1400 participants.
